# Session JSONL Streaming over MoQ

**Status:** Proposed (design ahead of implementation). No code ships in this PR.
**Scope:** design contract for `internal/moq` (PR 2a) and `internal/daemon/sessionstream` (PR 2b).
**Reviewed by:** four adversarial principal-engineer panels (security, streaming correctness,
daemon fit, simplicity), then remapped onto the current conversation model
(mono ADR-057/076/081/087, `packages/conversation`, `packages/chat`).

## Purpose

Stream each active coding session's redacted conversation to the cloud live, in parallel with
the existing stop-time git-commit upload. The git path remains the durability and fidelity
authority; the stream is a best-effort live feed. Applies uniformly to every shimmed agent
because both live producers (daemon tail mode and the Claude Code hook process) converge on
`raw.jsonl`.

The stream is **conversation-native**: it speaks the ontology's vocabulary (mono ADR-057/076/081)
so the server ingests it as a first-class conversation of `type='session'`. Coding sessions are
the first real consumer of live `type='session'` ingestion — this spec defines that producer
contract. Anything legacy-shaped (the git `data/sessions/…/{meta.json, turns.jsonl, …}` folder)
is a **server-side projection** of the conversation, per ADR-081's settled principle ("the git
folder is the conversation's projection") — the stream never contorts itself to look like the
old JSONL; the server down-converts when a legacy layer is wanted.

Gated by `FEATURE_SESSION_STREAMING` (default off). The env flag is a local opt-in only —
streaming starts only after the authenticated coordinates call succeeds, so the cloud's
account-level feature check is the authoritative enable.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Durability via the stream (git upload owns that; see Ack semantics).
- Losslessness. `raw.jsonl` reaches the ledger via git/LFS at stop; the stream is the live
  conversation feed, not a byte-replica channel.
- Bi-directional control (reserved: ADR-071 composition — a parallel Subscriber on a control
  track; nothing wired in v1).
- Rich workspace events (`artifact.*`, `widget.*`, `approval.*` from `workspace.events.jsonl`)
  — the envelope's `kind` space leaves room; v1 emits turns + tool events + lifecycle only.

## Identity & conversation binding

- The coding session id is **`ses_<UUIDv7>`**, minted at session start (already the case:
  `lfs.SessionMeta.EffectiveSessionID`). Its conversation is the twin **`cnv_<same-uuid>`** —
  a pure prefix swap (`ids.SessionIDToConversationID`), no lookup, lossless. The stream
  carries `conversation_id`; the server can swap back for the git projection.
- Never mint a `cnv_` payload different from the session's (keeps the 1:N-deferral twin rule
  intact). `cli_` is the `ox login` auth-session prefix and has nothing to do with this.
- The destination (team) binds on the first coordinates call and is immutable for the
  conversation's life, mirroring the `CaptureTurns` contract.
- Sub-references (`tool_use_id`, future `art_`/`wid_`) travel as separate fields, never
  `:`-joined composites.

Cursor (`stream-cursor.json`, session cache dir, 0600, atomic temp+rename) records the last
fully-published wire `seq`, the last published entry seq, the byte offset into `raw.jsonl`,
and a compact **wire-seq journal** (`seq` ↔ kind + `entry_seq`, contiguous runs collapsed
to ranges). Byte offset clamped to file size on load.

**Deterministic wire-seq assignment (what makes cursor loss safe).** The assignment of wire
seqs is defined as a **pure fold over `raw.jsonl` content**, not over runtime history:
header → `open` (always seq 1); each pause/resume lifecycle marker entry → one `lifecycle`
frame; entries inside suspended ranges → no seq; every other entry → one `turn`; footer →
`close` (last). Pause boundaries are themselves recorded in `raw.jsonl` (ADR-020 markers),
and pings are seq-less, so **the full assignment is recomputable from the file alone** —
the file plus its persisted pause markers IS the canonical eligible-frame stream. Live
send-commit assignment consumes exactly that persisted state (the fence reads the same
markers), so live publishing and replay reconstruction cannot produce different seq values.
The cursor's journal is therefore a cache, not the source of truth: on cursor loss the
publisher recomputes the assignment, resends, and the server's `(seq, revision)` dedup
absorbs the duplicates — replay can never mint new seqs for previously-delivered content.

**Rewrite generation & revision derivation.** The file's rewrite-generation counter is
persisted **beside the file identity** (durable sidecar next to `raw.jsonl`, not inside the
cursor), starting at 0 and bumped by every sanctioned rewrite. `revision` on replayed
frames **equals the file generation** — deterministic, unambiguous after any number of
rewrites, and it survives cursor loss. On cursor open, if the identity/generation does not
match (a rewrite happened), the publisher recomputes the assignment against the rewritten
file and republishes delivered frames under their original seqs at the new generation's
revision (see Dedup & amendments) — never silently-skipped or mid-record bytes. A lost
cursor over a never-rewritten file replays at revision 0: pure duplicates, dedup'd.

## Envelope (v1)

One JSON object per published payload. Vocabulary follows `conversation.TurnLine` (ADR-076)
extended with fidelity fields the transport can afford (MoQ fragments large objects; the
32 KiB/turn cap is a property of the MCP `CaptureTurns` endpoint, not of this stream — the
server applies caps at projection time):

```json
{"v":1, "conversation_id":"cnv_<uuidv7>", "seq":42, "revision":0, "kind":"turn",
 "turn":{
   "entry_seq":37,
   "role":"assistant", "author_kind":"coworker", "participant_kind":"agent",
   "content":"…redacted content…", "ts":"2026-07-17T01:02:03.456Z",
   "client_turn_id":"<eid>", "redacted":false,
   "tool_calls":[{"tool_use_id":"…", "name":"Bash", "summary":"…",
                   "input":{…}, "output":"…", "is_error":false}]
 }}
```

- `kind`: `open` | `turn` | `lifecycle` | `close`.
  - `open` — first frame: `session_id` (`ses_` twin), `session_name`, `repo_id`, `team_id`,
    agent/coworker identity, adapter name (from the raw.jsonl header / `StoreMeta`).
  - `turn` — one redacted conversation entry (mapping below).
  - `lifecycle` — `{event: pause|resume|stop|abort, reason, suspended_from_entry_seq?, resumed_at_entry_seq?}`.
  - `close` — final frame: `{finalize_reason}` (see Finalization).
- `seq` — the **wire sequence**: client-allocated, 1-based, dense, monotonically increasing
  across the durable frame kinds (one total order per conversation, mirroring the workspace
  model's single `event_seq` spine), **never renumbered**. Exactly the frames that are a
  deterministic function of `raw.jsonl` occupy seqs — `open`, `turn`, `lifecycle`, `close`
  (see Deterministic assignment below) — so every durable frame kind has a well-defined
  dedup/retry identity and the wire sequence has **no intentional gaps**: a server-observed
  gap always means undelivered frames. Liveness pings (`kind:"ping"`) are **seq-less and
  observational** — outside the dedup space, never journaled, never replayed — so ephemeral
  traffic can never make the wire assignment unreconstructable.
- `turn.entry_seq` — the raw.jsonl entry seq (stamped at write time; see below). This is the
  durable skeleton reference (pause ranges, erasure survivorship, git reconciliation) — a
  property of the *entry*, while `seq` is a property of the *transmission*.
- `revision` — amendment counter, default `0` (see Dedup & amendments).
- `client_turn_id` — the entry `eid`; secondary idempotency identity that survives
  re-publication under a new wire `seq` or `revision`.
- `ts` is advisory (multi-process producers, clock skew); `seq` orders.

### Dedup & amendments

- Server dedup key: `(conversation_id, seq, revision)` — first-writer-wins **within a
  revision**. Duplicates are expected (at-least-once); resends carry the same `seq` and
  `revision` and are dropped.
- A **higher `revision` for an existing `seq` is an amendment, not a duplicate**: it
  supersedes the prior revision as a superseding revision with lineage (ADR-057 v3 revision
  machinery, exactly as ADR-087 D9 prescribes for late-delivery re-finalization). An
  amendment is only an amendment **at the original wire `seq`** — guaranteed by the
  deterministic assignment: the same fold over the (rewritten) file yields the same seqs. A
  post-rewrite replay re-publishes each **previously delivered** frame under its original
  wire `seq` at `revision = file generation` (so the redacted content supersedes the stale
  revision rather than landing beside it — deterministic even after multiple rewrites and
  after cursor loss); content that had **not** been delivered before the rewrite takes
  fresh seqs at the current generation as its first revision. Late-drain resends of
  undelivered frames are not amendments — same seq, same revision, dedup handles them.
- Amendments never resurrect purged content: deletion/erasure tombstones win over any
  revision (server-enforced; publisher drops its backlog on a tombstone response).
- Consumers strict-decode per the ontology convention (ADR-076 chunks are fail-loud): any
  added field is a version bump of `v`. This is stricter than the adapter-protocol
  ignore-unknown rule, and deliberate — it matches the model this stream feeds.

Frame-kind idempotency beyond the dedup key: `open` is additionally idempotent by
`conversation_id` (re-`open` after reconnect is a no-op server-side); `close` by
`(conversation_id, finalize_reason)` with the highest delivered `seq` as its watermark.

### Mapping `SessionEntry` → `turn`

| `SessionEntry` (raw.jsonl) | stream `turn` |
|---|---|
| `type: user` | `role: user`, `author_kind: human`, `participant_kind: human` |
| `type: assistant` | `role: assistant`, `author_kind: coworker`, `participant_kind: agent` |
| `type: tool` | `role: tool`, `author_kind: tool`, `participant_kind: agent` |
| `type: system` | `role: tool`, `author_kind: tool`, `participant_kind: service` |
| `content` | `content` (already redacted) |
| `ts` | `ts` |
| `seq` (entry) | `turn.entry_seq` |
| `eid` | `client_turn_id` |
| `tool_name` / `tool_input` / `tool_output` / `is_error` | one `tool_calls[]` element (`name`, `input`, `output`, `is_error`; `summary` = server-truncatable digest) |
| `coworker_name` / `coworker_model` | `open` frame identity + per-turn omitted (constant per session today) |

Gap called out for PR 2b: `SessionEntry` has no `tool_use_id` today. Adapters that receive it
(Claude Code hooks do) should pass it through; the field is optional on the wire. When absent,
the server keys tool pairing on `(conversation_id, seq)`.

### seq/eid stamping (new, PR 2b)

Live-recorded entries carry no `seq`/`eid` today (the seq-injecting `SessionWriter` in
`internal/session/store.go` is not on the live path). PR 2b adds `Seq int64` + `Eid string`
to `session.SessionEntry`, stamped inside `RawWriter.WriteEntry` — running count since
header, 1-based. Every consumer benefits; redaction path unchanged.

## Pause exclusion (publish-time, CRITICAL)

Pause/resume is upload-time filtering today (ADR-020): raw.jsonl keeps receiving entries
while paused. The session spine's rule is **fail-closed: paused means no content lands**
(off-the-record = `pause` + `reason:"off_the_record"`). The publisher therefore:

1. Consults `RecordingState.SuspendedAt` + lifecycle pause markers per entry.
2. **Never publishes** any `turn` whose entry seq lies in an open or closed suspended range —
   not even a redacted tombstone (tombstones would still leak that something happened, and
   fail-closed means nothing lands). The read position still advances. Withheld entries
   consume **no wire `seq`**, so the wire sequence stays dense and gap accounting never
   requests a resend of withheld content.
3. Publishes `lifecycle` frames: `pause` with `suspended_from_entry_seq`, `resume` with
   `resumed_at_entry_seq` — the skeleton record that entries `[from, at)` were withheld by
   consent, referenced in entry-seq space.
4. **Atomic publication fence (the linearization point), evaluated per FRAME.** Pause
   activation persists the effective `suspended_from_entry_seq` to the pause marker *before*
   it returns to the user (existing atomic temp+rename). The publisher re-reads that fence
   **once per frame, immediately before the frame's FIRST fragment is written** — the
   send-commit point. The decision is frame-atomic: a frame whose `entry_seq` is at or past
   the fence is discarded whole (its wire `seq` is reused by the next frame — wire seqs are
   assigned at send-commit, not read time); a frame that passes the fence sends **all** of
   its fragments, even if a pause lands mid-frame. Frames are never torn — fragments of one
   frame are never split across a discard, so partial content can never reach the relay.
   This is still fail-closed: the fence's meaning is range membership (`entry_seq` inside a
   suspended range never lands), not wall-clock ordering — an entry recorded before the
   pause boundary is publishable by definition, and an entry at/past it can never be
   transmitted regardless of when it was read.

Distinct from redaction: a secret-redacted entry (inline redactor) still flows as a normal
`turn` with scrubbed `content`. A fully-suppressed turn, if ox ever adds one, follows the
ontology rule `content:"" + redacted:true` so the seq skeleton stays complete. Erasure
semantics (bodies die, skeleton survives: seq, ids, boundaries) are server-side; the stream's
structure-relative references (wire `seq`, `entry_seq`, `client_turn_id`, `tool_use_id` —
never byte offsets) are what make that possible.

## Ack semantics (honest version)

moq-lite has no object-level acknowledgment; a successful send means bytes left the process
(ADR-071 — and per ADR-087, the receipt plane is still "Proposed, unratified, unbuilt: no
surface can bind a receipt plane the server doesn't ship"). Cursor advance therefore encodes
local send success, NOT durability. Durability stands on the local buffer (`raw.jsonl` +
cursor — which also clears ADR-087 D7's ≥5-minute local-durability floor by construction,
since the buffer is the session file itself) and on the git upload.

If a receipt plane is added later, it mirrors the shapes mono already ships or specifies:
out-of-band watermark (ADR-071 Option A) carrying the `CaptureTurns`-style self-healing pair
`{last_captured_seq, missing_ranges}` over the wire sequence — the client resends everything
after `last_captured_seq`; the server dedups by `(seq, revision)`, first-writer-wins within
a revision. Because withheld (paused) entries never consume wire seqs, `missing_ranges` can
only ever name genuinely undelivered frames.

## Lifecycle & finalization (session spine + ADR-087 D9)

- The stream binds to the **session spine** FSM (`active / paused / stopped`; verbs
  `start → pause ⇄ resume → stop | abort`), not the audio capture spine. Turns flow only in
  `active`. `abort` discards; `stop` finalizes.
- `close` carries **`finalize_reason ∈ {explicit-stop, abort}`** from the producer;
  `staleness-presumed` is server-assigned only. If the daemon dies mid-session, the server
  may finalize as `staleness-presumed` (~1 h without a real liveness signal — the stream's
  own frames are that signal; an idle-but-alive publisher emits a sparse `lifecycle`
  liveness ping so silence is never inferred from wire absence alone).
- **Abort on the wire — durable intent, then cleanup.** On abort the publisher first
  persists a local **abort-intent marker** (atomic, in the session cache dir), then drops
  its unsent backlog (content is never sent — the safe direction) and emits
  `close{finalize_reason:"abort"}`. The marker clears **only on server-confirmed tombstone
  persistence**: a successful authenticated HTTPS abort response from the coordinates
  endpoint (or, in the future, a receipt-plane ack). Relay-level send of the close frame is
  best-effort notification and **never clears the marker** — the honest-ack doctrine
  applies to aborts too: send success is not persistence. The HTTPS abort is retried with
  backoff and survives process restart via the marker (`DetectAndRestart` re-attaches to
  abort-intent sessions too).
  This closes the lost-close hole: a crash after backlog cleanup can no longer strand a
  partial stream that the server would later `staleness-presumed`-finalize and project.
  Server-side, abort discards the conversation's streamed content (no projection, no
  summary derivation) and records a tombstone — an aborted session must never be projected
  as a normally-stopped one, and late frames for an aborted conversation are dropped by the
  tombstone rule; the HTTPS abort suppresses any pending staleness finalization.
- **Finalization is provisional and amendable; the FSM never reopens** (ADR-087 D9). A
  daemon that restarts after a `staleness-presumed` finalize keeps draining from its cursor:
  the client state is `stopped` (control) × `draining` (durability debt) — two axes, not a
  reopened session. Late frames are an amendment trigger: the server re-finalizes
  idempotently, keyed on the **delivered watermark of `(seq → highest revision)`** — not the
  bare seq set, since an amendment changes content without changing the seq set — and
  recomputes derived artifacts whenever any seq's highest delivered revision increases,
  superseding them with lineage.
  Amendment MUST respect deletion tombstones — a purged conversation is never resurrected,
  and the publisher drops its backlog on a tombstone response.
- Continuing work later is a **new source-session with its own `ses_` id and therefore its
  own `cnv_` twin** — never a reopened stream, and never a foreign `cnv_` binding: the
  `ses_ ↔ cnv_` prefix swap must stay bijective and lossless (the ontology's 1:N deferral
  rule), so a continuation cannot publish under a prior session's conversation id. Linking
  the continuation to the earlier conversation as one logical thread is a **server-side
  association**, deferred to the platform's independently-minted-`cnv_` (1:N) work — ADR-087
  D9's "same conversation, one level up" lands there, not in this producer's identity rules.

## Transport

moq-lite-04 over WebSocket TLS (TCP/443), pure Go (`internal/moq`):

- Relay already exposes WS ingress; ESP32 firmware proves the path; no Go MoQ client exists;
  avoids a QUIC dependency. Dep: `coder/websocket` (MIT).
- One WS binary message per MoQ frame; OFF+LEN fragmentation above 16 KiB (qmux frame cap);
  group rotation on a small bound (N entries / M seconds) so reconnect never replays
  unbounded groups (a group is the resume unit; never resume mid-group).
- Coordinates `{broadcast_name, relay_url, jwt}` come from a new api-go endpoint (request
  `{session_id, session_name}`) — the coding-session analog of recordings `mode:"moq"`, and
  the ensure-conversation step: the server derives/creates the `cnv_` twin and binds the
  destination team on first call. All three coordinates are opaque to ox. JWTs are ~1 h:
  re-fetch on reconnect/near-expiry via OAuth `EnsureValidToken`; JWT held in memory only.
- Fail closed: `wss://` required off-loopback; never `InsecureSkipVerify`;
  `OX_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_ENDPOINT` does not loosen MoQ TLS except loopback (twin tests).
- Decoder treats relay input as untrusted: strict bounds checks, frame/object size caps,
  typed errors, no panics.

## Daemon integration (`internal/daemon/sessionstream`)

- `Manager` discovers active recordings (`.recording.json` scan), one publisher goroutine per
  session; re-attaches on daemon start (`DetectAndRestart` pattern) — including post-finalize
  draining sessions.
- Hook-mode session activity feeds the daemon inactivity timer so a live Claude Code session
  cannot idle-exit the daemon mid-stream (1 h timeout today).
- Resilience: `resilience.CircuitBreaker` + exponential backoff; reconnect re-fetches
  coordinates, resumes from cursor at a group boundary. All failures log-only (single-line
  key=value); never surfaced to session flow. Flag off ⇒ Manager never constructed.
- Read-ahead bounded by bytes (backpressure), not entry count — `tool_output` entries can be
  multi-MB.
- Tailer consumes only `\n`-terminated lines; on EOF with unterminated trailing bytes it does
  not advance (torn-write safety). New raw-jsonl `ParseLineFunc` dispatches header/entry/footer.
- `rewriteRawJSONL` (regenerate/redact) refuses to rewrite a session with an active
  recording, and while a stream is **draining** it must either wait for drain completion or
  **bump the file's rewrite generation** (recorded next to the header identity). The cursor's
  generation check makes a rewrite-under-cursor impossible to miss: byte offsets are never
  trusted across a generation change; the streamer resets to a safe replay point and
  re-publishes as an amendment (`revision+1`). A stale byte offset can therefore never skip
  data or resume mid-record.

## Projection: the legacy layer is derived, not streamed

The server converts the conversation-native stream into whatever layers consumers need:

- **Conversation-native storage** (canonical): turns + tool executions + lifecycle under the
  `cnv_` id, exactly as MCP capture already stores chat (ADR-076 chunks / ADR-081 rows).
- **Legacy git session folder** (`data/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/<ses_id>-<slug>/…` with
  `turns.jsonl` `KBTurnLine`s, `meta.json`, `tool-execs/<tool_use_id>.json`): a projection,
  derived by prefix-swapping `cnv_`→`ses_` and down-converting turns (`role`→`author_kind`,
  `tool_calls` full bodies → `tool-execs/` files + `extras.tool_use` digests, caps applied).
  ADR-081 already defines the git folder as "the conversation's projection" — this stream
  just extends that principle to live coding sessions.
- ox itself keeps committing `raw.jsonl` via git/LFS at stop (unchanged); the server may
  reconcile stream-ingested turns against the settled artifact at amendment time.

## Cloud contract (mono-side, required before customer enable)

1. Coordinates endpoint = ensure-conversation (`ses_`→`cnv_` twin, team binding, account
   feature check `features.session_streaming`) + relay JWT minting + an authenticated
   **abort** operation (the durable fallback for `close{finalize_reason:"abort"}` when the
   relay path is unavailable: records the tombstone and suppresses any pending staleness
   finalization).
2. Subscriber ingesting `type='session'` conversations: `(seq, revision)` dedup
   (first-writer-wins within a revision, higher revision supersedes with lineage),
   suspended-range skeleton from `lifecycle` frames, abort-discard handling,
   amendment-idempotent re-finalization (ADR-087 D9), deletion-tombstone enforcement.
3. Purge/re-redact API keyed `(conversation_id, seq)` — prerequisite for customer enablement
  (retroactive redaction below); aligns with the ontology's suppression/erasure fork
  (skeleton survives, bodies die).
4. Session archiver with narrowest `get` (per-team; ideally per-broadcast JIT), separate
   service identity + prefix namespace from the audio archiver; asymmetric relay signing
   (EdDSA/RS256) recommended.
5. Optional later: receipt plane per ADR-071 Option A with `{last_captured_seq, missing_ranges}`.

## Retroactive redaction (policy)

The deferred redaction tier (pre-push auto-redact/quarantine, `ox session redact`, catalog
re-scans) fires after write time and can only scrub local copies. Live streaming forfeits
that net for already-streamed bytes. Policy: dogfood-only until the mono purge/re-redact API
(keyed `(conversation_id, seq)`) exists; the retroactive-redact code paths call it when
streaming was active for the session. Customer enablement blocks on that API.

## Implementation phases

| PR | Lands | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| 2a | `internal/moq` client + codec + `moqtest` twin + goldens | transport in isolation (riskiest unit) |
| 2b | seq/eid stamping, `sessionstream` manager, cursor, pause lifecycle frames, envelope mapping, resilience, this spec | end-to-end tail-to-relay with a twin |

Test harness (PR 2b): codec round-trip + conformance; envelope-mapping goldens
(`SessionEntry` → `turn` table above); one twin round-trip E2E (twin's received turns equal
redacted `raw.jsonl` entries minus suspended ranges, with pause/resume lifecycle frames at
the right entry seqs and a dense gap-free wire sequence); cursor crash-safety (crash at
every step around publish/cursor-write, no loss, dedup on `(conversation_id, seq,
revision)`); **pause-fence race test** (entries **at or past the persisted suspension
boundary** must never reach the twin regardless of when they were read or enqueued —
exercise the read-then-pause-then-send interleaving deliberately; entries below the
boundary MAY legitimately land after the pause instant, per the frame-atomic
range-membership contract); **rewrite generation test** (rewrite `raw.jsonl` under a
draining cursor, assert replay **under the original wire seqs** at `revision = generation`
— the stale revision superseded, never a duplicate beside it, never a mid-record resume);
**lost-cursor recovery test** (delete `stream-cursor.json` mid-stream with pauses and
lifecycle frames on record; restart; assert the recomputed assignment reproduces the
original wire seqs exactly — duplicates dedup'd, no fresh seqs for delivered content);
**mid-frame pause test** (pause landing between fragments of a large frame: the frame
completes whole, the next suspended frame is discarded whole — no torn frames at the twin);
**abort test** (backlog dropped, abort-intent marker persisted, only
`close{finalize_reason:"abort"}` arrives, twin marks tombstone, late frames dropped — plus
the close-loss variant: kill the publisher after backlog cleanup but before close delivery,
restart, assert the abort intent is retried to confirmation and no content is ever
projected); **revision-after-finalize test** (deliver a `revision = generation` amendment
after finalization; assert derived artifacts recompute and supersede with lineage); pause
fail-closed test; flag-off test (zero network, zero stream files). Deferred until mono locks
the consumer: 5-way relay fault matrix, full golden wire suite, staging-relay integration.
