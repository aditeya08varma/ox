# SageOx (ox) - Team Context for AI Coworkers

ox is a CLI that gives AI coworkers shared team context: conventions, architectural decisions, session recording, and collaborative knowledge that persists across sessions and teammates.

## When to Use

- **Starting work**: Run `ox agent prime` to load team context (conventions, norms, decisions)
- **Recording sessions**: `ox agent session start` / `ox agent session stop` to capture work to the project ledger
- **Checking health**: `ox status` for auth/sync/daemon state, `ox doctor` for diagnostics
- **Initializing**: `ox init` to set up SageOx in a new repository

## Key Concepts

- **Team Context** - shared conventions, norms, and architectural decisions (versioned)
- **Ledger** - historical record of sessions, decisions, and discussions
- **Session** - a recorded human-to-AI coworker conversation
- **AI Coworker** - an AI participant on a team (not "agent" in user-facing output)

## Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ox agent prime` | Load team context for this session |
| `ox agent session start` | Begin recording a session |
| `ox agent session stop` | Stop recording and push to ledger |
| `ox status` | Check auth, sync, daemon health |
| `ox doctor` | Run diagnostic checks |
| `ox init` | Initialize SageOx in a repository |
| `ox conventions` | Get verified team coding standards |
| `ox session list` | List recent sessions from ledger |

## Searching Code, History, PRs

`ox code` queries the local CodeDB index (symbols, resolved call graph, diffs, git history, indexed PRs/issues/comments). Reach for it before grep/ripgrep on this repo.

Verb-mode (preferred — match on the intent verb):

| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Symbol definition | `ox code defs <name>` |
| Who calls <name> (resolved call graph) | `ox code callers <name>` |
| What <name> calls (transitive via --depth) | `ox code callees <name> --depth 2` |
| Text references | `ox code refs <name> [--lang go]` |
| Commits touching <path> | `ox code log <path> [--author X] [--after YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| PR triage (most stalled first) | `ox code prs --sort stalled` |
| Recent GitHub activity | `ox code activity --since 7d` |
| Hotspots & contention | `ox code insights` |
| Index health | `ox code status` |

DSL-mode (when verbs don't fit):

| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Search PRs/issues by content | `ox code search "<text>" type:pr` (or `type:issue`) |
| Source comments by kind | `ox code search "<text>" type:comment ckind:todo` |
| Git history + content together | `ox code search "<text>" author:<n> after:<date>` |
| Forced regex | `ox code search "/<pattern>/"` |
| Full DSL grammar | `ox code search --help` |

Fall back to grep/ripgrep only for exact-string matches in known files or
when `ox code` returns 0 results. See `.claude/rules/ox-code.md` (when shipped
into the project) for the full decision tree.

## Requirements

Install the ox CLI: `brew install sageox/tap/ox` or visit https://sageox.ai/install
