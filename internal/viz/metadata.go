	"dependency-graph":        "Cluster by ownership, make the shared/contended dependency central, and label only consequential edges. Every connector must visibly terminate at the boundary of its source and destination; never leave a floating arrow or route an edge through a label. Avoid a uniform hairball.",
	"state-machine":           "Derive the primary path from the reviewer question and keep the feature-defining loop central; do not demote it into a decorative secondary band. Use a left-to-right happy path, with retries below it. Highlight one transition under review; terminal states need unmistakable visual closure.",
	"swimlane-timeline":       "Use one shared horizontal clock and no more than five lanes. Bars describe work; arrows describe handoff. Keep lane labels outside the work area.",
	"gantt":                   "Use actual dates only. Show critical dependencies and one decision milestone; omit speculative precision and decorative progress bars.",
	"sparkline":               "Use one signal inline beside the sentence it supports—no title card, frame, or full-width plate. For axes, a threshold, or a causal annotation, promote it to a line chart.",
	"small-multiples":         "Use only for three or more comparable series. Keep scales identical, render series as unfilled strokes, and annotate the outlier; do not put a lone tiny chart inside a decorative card.",
	"before-after":            "If the delta is a 2–5-node linear path, use GitHub-safe Mermaid or two concise code snippets instead. Use a rich comparison only for a structural change that needs mirrored multi-step evidence; make the changed ownership or path the only high-contrast delta.",
	"decision-matrix":         "Limit to 3–5 options and 3–5 criteria. Make the recommendation visible but preserve the decisive trade-off; never imply false numeric precision.",
	"heatmap-table":           "Use a stable sequential scale with visible values only where they alter the decision. Sort rows and columns to reveal the hotspot.",
	"cost-telemetry-table":    "Keep units in every column and use emphasis only for the stage that changes the decision. Pair totals with the relevant budget, not a decorative badge.",

	"line-chart":              "Use a true time axis, one visible threshold, and annotations at causal changes. Render each series as a connected unfilled stroke; do not use an opaque area or polygon unless area is the explicit encoding. Use shared-scale facets rather than stacking incompatible units.",

	"status-pair":             "Use only for a real shipped-versus-not-built or healthy-versus-degraded state, with one decisive metric or checklist delta. Do not use it to redraw a simple architecture change; a Mermaid flow or prose is clearer.",
	"wordmark":                "Use only when a user explicitly asks for a standalone brand component. Do not add it to technical PR visuals, diagrams, charts, or their footers by default.",
	"risk-register":           "Use one dense scan row per risk: severity, risk, resolution, owner. Reveal mechanism and fallback only on demand.",
	"architecture":            "Use named zones, orthogonal edges, and one trust or ownership boundary. Keep the hero view under seven nodes; split detail rather than shrink type.",
	"flowchart":               "Use verb actions and question diamonds. Keep the happy path straight, exceptional exits lateral, and label every branch condition.",
	"data-flow":               "Separate sources, transformations, and consumers. Put the changing data contract on the edge that carries it; never use arrows as decoration.",
	"layer-stack":             "Each band needs a distinct responsibility and boundary. Keep ordering meaningful and make the enforcement layer visually decisive.",
	"timeline":                "Use one real or relative axis with 3–7 inflection points. Annotate the event that changed the trajectory, not every date.",
	"loop":                    "Show 3–5 directed, unfilled arrow paths and the durable shared state at the hub. Never draw the loop as a filled/closed shape. If there is no durable feedback or the cycle has only two steps, use a Mermaid flowchart instead.",
	"execution-trace":         "Use aligned core/task lanes on one clock. Encode executing, runnable wait, blocking I/O, and handoff differently; highlight the span that gates completion.",
	"event-stream":            "Use only when durable fan-out, replay, or independent consumer ownership matters. Show producer, topic, and consumers with direct-label edges; otherwise prefer a compact Mermaid flow. Preserve ordering without drawing it as a synchronous call chain.",
	"operational-time-series": "Use aligned facets for unlike units, a deploy/incident marker, and an explicit threshold. Correlate signals on time—not on a deceptive dual axis.",
