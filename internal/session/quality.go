// produce a score, decide disposition at the callsite (typically
// QualityUpload with a stub summary) rather than routing through this
// function. An older version of this code treated score <= 0 as "unscored →
// upload," which conflated an empty session the LLM correctly scored 0 with
// the truly-unscored case and quietly published header-only sessions to the
// team ledger (see #525).

// EvaluateQualityCategory maps a categorical quality label to a

// — numeric scales cluster on round numbers and ignore fine-grained
// rubric distinctions, while LLMs are far more reliable picking from a
// small named set with anchored examples.
//
// Unknown / empty category returns QualityUpload by design: an
// unrecognized string from a legacy or future summary should default to
// preserving the artifact, not silently discarding it. Callers that have
// a numeric score on hand should use EvaluateQuality instead — this
// function refuses to guess. The decision to upload an unknown category
// matches the existing "unscored fallbacks default to upload" policy in
// session_finalize.go's ProcessResult.
